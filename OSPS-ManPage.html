<P>OSPS -  (&ocirc; sp -s z ) as in auspices.  Obfuscated Server Port
Service.</P>
<P>OSPS is a service port generator and cryptographic communication
system.  OSPS is designed to make it easier for  you to implement
need-to-know security for your server port #'s. OSPS is a simple but
effective system for making  your private services that much harder
to hack.  If your IDS/IPS is working then you should be fairly able
to detect a port scan looking for open services and you can defend
against those to a degree but if you are running your services on WKS
ports then scanning isn't required nor is any &ldquo;man in the
middle attack&rdquo;.  OSPS is designed to hide the service port #'s
from those who do not need to know and yet make them available to
those who do need to know.</P>
<P>Services running under the OSPS of OSPS get their listening port
number randomly generated on a regular basis.  When it's time to
choose a new port OSPS generates the port # and restarts the service.
 OSPS then uses public key encryption to encrypt the new port #
information for all of the authorized users of the service and then
places that file in a well known location.  Since it is encrypted the
port # file can even be placed in a public location, emailed to all
authorized users or placed in a well know but secure location all of
which is supported by OSPS.</P>
<P>How does OSPS work.</P>
<P>Generating new port numbers for services.   The operation of OSPS
has been modeled after chkconfig which should be familiar to modern
system admins.</P>
<P>Invocation:</P>
<P>osps --debug=\d+ --verbose --ffile {path to OSPSified config file}</P>
<P>An OSPSified config file will contain the following lines at the
start of the file</P>
<P># OSPS v.$x as the first line.</P>
<P># osps:  port_range=n-m {Acceptable port range}</P>
<P># osps: encryptor (encryptor and argument list)</P>
<P># osps: user list (this list will be passed to encryptor &amp;
notify if notify = mail)</P>
<P># osps:  notify (none|mail|/path/to/status/file)</P>
<P>and optionally</P>
<P>#osps: additional files (absolute path to additional OSPSified
configuration files which need to be synchronized with this
configuration file.</P>
<P>If any of these lines is non-existent osps will exit with an error
message.</P>
<P>Scheduling:</P>
<P>OSPS contains no scheduling information on how often to regenerate
port #'s OSPS expects to be called by a scheduler/security system
when it's time to change port #'s.</P>
<P>OSPS reads /etc/OSPS.conf to decide get it's task list.</P>
